Hi there. 

I know what you're wondering... WHAT, BRUH.

Don't fear, I have created a calculator that allows for easy calculations of reflections. 

Also stay tuned for future updates, where we add other types of transformations (especially rotations!)

Replit link in case you wanna run it conveniently: https://replit.com/@blitcssh/reflections-calculator#README.md

This calculator is unique in that it works for reflections over **ALL** lines instead of just things like y = x. Have fun experimenting!

Any errors can be reported to my email at: 25benjaminli@gmail.com
