Hi there. 

I know what you're wondering... WHAT, BRUH.

Don't fear, I have created a calculator that allows for easy calculations of transformations (at the moment, reflections over any line as well as dilations over any center of dilation). 

Replit link in case you wanna run it conveniently: https://replit.com/@blitcssh/reflections-calculator#README.md

Have fun experimenting!
